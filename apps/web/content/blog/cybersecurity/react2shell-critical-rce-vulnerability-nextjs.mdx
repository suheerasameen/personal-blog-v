A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the React Server Components protocol. It's being called **React2Shell** and it's as bad as it sounds.

## The Bottom Line

- **CVE**: CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js), CVE-2025-55182 (React)
- **Severity**: CVSS 10.0 (Critical)
- **Impact**: Remote Code Execution
- **Action Required**: Upgrade immediately

If your Next.js app was online and unpatched as of December 4th, 2025, **rotate your secrets**.

## What Is React2Shell?

The vulnerability exists in the React Server Components (RSC) protocol. Attackers can craft malicious requests that influence server-side execution behavior, leading to **remote code execution** on unpatched servers.

This isn't theoretical—[AWS has reported](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/china-nexus-cyber-threat-groups-rapidly-exploit-react2shell-vulnerability-cve-2025-55182/) that China-nexus cyber threat groups are actively exploiting this vulnerability in the wild.

## Am I Affected?

**You ARE affected if you're running:**
- Next.js 15.x with App Router
- Next.js 16.x with App Router
- Next.js 14.3.0-canary.77 or later canary releases

**You are NOT affected if you're using:**
- Next.js 13.x
- Next.js 14.x stable releases
- Pages Router (any version)
- Edge Runtime

## How to Patch

### Option 1: Use the automated tool

```bash
npx fix-react2shell-next
```

This interactive tool checks your version and performs the upgrade automatically.

### Option 2: Manual upgrade

Pick the patch for your version:

```bash
npm install next@15.0.5   # for 15.0.x
npm install next@15.1.9   # for 15.1.x
npm install next@15.2.6   # for 15.2.x
npm install next@15.3.6   # for 15.3.x
npm install next@15.4.8   # for 15.4.x
npm install next@15.5.7   # for 15.5.x
npm install next@16.0.7   # for 16.0.x
```

For canary releases:
```bash
npm install next@15.6.0-canary.58  # for 15.x canary
npm install next@16.1.0-canary.12  # for 16.x canary
```

If you're on a 14.x canary, downgrade to stable:
```bash
npm install next@14
```

## After Patching: Rotate Your Secrets

Once you've upgraded and redeployed, rotate all your environment variables. Start with the most critical ones:

- Database credentials
- API keys
- JWT secrets
- OAuth client secrets
- Encryption keys

If your app was exposed, assume they were compromised.

## Timeline

- **December 3, 2025**: React team publishes security advisory
- **December 4, 2025**: Patches released for Next.js
- **December 6, 2025**: Vercel releases `fix-react2shell-next` tool
- **Ongoing**: Active exploitation reported by AWS, Akamai, and others

## What Actually Happened?

The vulnerability is in how RSC deserializes untrusted inputs. Vercel and the React team are intentionally limiting technical details to protect developers who haven't patched yet.

What we know:
- It's a deserialization vulnerability
- It allows RCE (Remote Code Execution)
- It only affects Server Components (App Router)
- Pages Router and Edge Runtime use different code paths
